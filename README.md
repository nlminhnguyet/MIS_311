##  4. Key Insights

### 🔹 Insight 1: Weak Correlation Between Income and Living Costs

<img width="927" height="353" alt="{B12412C3-7B3C-4BEE-84F9-37127307467E}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3e2b090-a623-4e08-8fab-78ecf0979104" />

- A **scatter plot** of income vs. cost of living reveals **no strong linear relationship**.
- Some nations with **high living costs** do **not necessarily** offer high incomes.
- Conversely, some countries with **low costs** show relatively **high income levels**.

>  This suggests that **income and expenses are influenced by separate economic forces** in different countries.

### 🔹 Insight 2: Regional Financial Disparities

<img width="755" height="376" alt="{B09630EB-9871-42D9-9A7A-7A80C09EE364}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82324e7e-bf0f-4852-959d-6df940dd64b2" />

- A **bar chart** comparing regional totals shows:
  - **Europe** and **Asia** lead in overall income and expenses, reflecting **high economic activity**.
  - **North America** shows a **smaller gap** between income and living costs, hinting at **tighter financial margins**.

>  These differences underscore how **regional economic structures and living standards** influence financial stability and potential savings.

---

##  Conclusion

The **Cost of Living** dataset provides meaningful insights into **global economic conditions** by examining the balance between income and expenses. Through careful data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, we can identify patterns of inequality, financial health, and affordability across the world.
